# Task 3: Insights

# 1. Referring to plot 1, are there certain characteristics about countries that sign many BIT agreements
# #vis-a-vis those that sign few? You may reference other data (such as regime type or GDP data used
# #in class) to investigate your claim. 

# Countries that sign many BIT agreements are those with relatively high GDP and GDP per capital. These countries are always with high democratic level, attaches great importance to diplomacy, and more open. According to the data from World bank, these countries are always higher cross-border trade volume.

# 2. Referring to plot 2, are there moments in time when countries entered into more or less BIT agreements? If so, can you speculate why?

# there are surges in signed BIT agreements in 1990s and 2000s, ther are less before 1980 and after 2000. The reason may be the surge did something with the development of WTO and the decline may be correlated with COVID-19.

# 3. Referring to plot 3, does one country (among the four on the x-axis) enter into noticeably more or fewer BITs than the other three? If so, what is it about this country compared to the other three that might explain this difference?

# The US has noticeably less BITs than other three countries, compared to other countries, US has higher GDP and GDP per capital, which means it rely on less on the relationship with other countries. China has more BITs than other countries, for it attaches great importance to the relationship with other countries.
